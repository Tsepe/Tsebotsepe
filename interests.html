				Having to talk about my bucket list,<br>maybe favourite cities&#127961, well,<mark> New<br> York City</mark>&#128509 is on my backet list. i<br>
				would like to go there some day, i<br>
				mean who wouldnt want to be there<br>
				if given chnace? But unlike everybody<br>
				visit there for my persion of software<br>
				development, my choice is based on the<br>
				city's spot light, everybody knows<br>
				NYC, anything that happens there,<br>
				evryone would want a piece of pie,<br>
				so a succeful idea in NYC would<br>
				surely be a good one to the world.<br>
				for the same reason but different<br>
				point of view, i would like to visit<br><mark>
				Dubai, Dubai</mark> been a raply developing<br>
				Arabic place, and business for software<br>
				would surely take the place race to the&#128204<br>
				world

			<b>	&#128204&#128203Talking of my bucket list, setting foot<br>
				on Mars is surely on top 5, i mean who<br>
				wouldn'd want to go there&#127770#127770, well i know<br>
				who, teachers from primary school<br>
				surely still believe theres still no<br>
				life there, i guess i have to put it in<br>
				my bucket list to go update them&#128517&#128517&#128517.<br>
				travelling from one continent to the<br>
				other cost a lot, imagine from a planet<br>
				to the other, as much as i think it is<br>
				very expensive, i dont think that will<br>
				stop me from going there, i will rob the<br>
				bank,&#128178&#128176 get some cash, i mean that will be<br> 
				money too, well thats a joke&#128514&#128514&#128514&#128517, i will have<br>
				to get my money right befor such a big<br>
				move, and getting it right part of my<br>
				bucket list, top 2. but NASA&#128640 have to know<br>
				one of them coming days, i will be a<br>

			<b>	&#128204&#128203As much as i believe its not my<br>
				business that Drugs&#128286 have affected<br>
				alot of today generation, mostly youth<br>
				and most painfully &#128148&#128148youngsters i believe<br>
				i can bring change to the world. How? good<br>
				question, i am goaling to start a charity,<br>
				charity for evryone who is enslaved by the<br>
				use of drugs, this charity will firstly focus<br>
				on Basotho as thats the least i could do for<br>
				starters and i am concerned that Lesotho might<br>
				be one of the countries without such charity. As<br>
				much as being under influence of drugs is said<br>
				to be unbarebly amazing by the users, i can can<br>
				tell it must be a nightmare&#128560 when the drugs start<br>
				using you so much you cant leave the, charity is<br>
				the unswer to such. Thats on my bucket list too.&#128204<br>
